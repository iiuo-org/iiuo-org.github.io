## Style Guidelines

- Design should remain **plain, flat, professional** — no shadows.  
- Use color palette: **black (#000000), white (#ffffff), red (#ff3b3b), sky‑blue (#00bfff)**.  
- Keep typography clean and simple.  
- Ensure 100% responsiveness: mobile, tablet, desktop.  
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup (alt text for images, aria attributes where needed).

## Contribution & Support

We welcome contributions! Whether you fix a typo, improve responsive behavior, or add a new section — your help matters.

- Please open an issue describing your change.  
- Submit a pull request with clear description.  
- Adhere to the coding style and don’t introduce heavy frameworks — keep it minimal.
